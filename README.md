This program lets you make visual music sheets for Sky: Children of the Light. It is written in Python and does not require previous knowledge of the command line to run. 

As well as using QWERT ASDFG ZXCVB keys as the keyboard, there are other supported notations:

- Sky notation (A1 A2 A3 A4 A5, B1 B2 B3 B4 B5, C1 C2 C3 C4 C5)
- Western notation (C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, B4)
- Jianpu (1 2 3 4 5 6 7, followed by + or - for octaves)

You can type these in the command line, or save in a text file and import it.

SVG icons are thanks to [madwurmz](http://madwurmz.com), and thanks to mimizan for support for importing TXT files and using ABC1-5 notation, Jianpu notation and Western notation.
